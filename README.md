Triumph
=======

An OpenGL, Cross-platgorm Game Engine project based on GLFW and GLEW.

Installation
------------

First you need to ensure you have the [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org) library installed.

You also need to have [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) installed.

For linux systems, run:
	
	make x11

For Windows and Mac OS X, there is a Visual Studio 2010 and an XCode 4 project
ready to go. You will need to make sure the include and library paths sync up with
the install locations of GLFW and GLEW.
