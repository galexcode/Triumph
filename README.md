This is the skeleton for a cross-platform C++ grand strategy game 
engine based only on the simple GLFW base.

Installation
------------

First you need to ensure you have the [glfw](http://www.glfw.org) library installed.

For linux systems, run:
	
	make x11

For Windows and Mac OS X, there is a Visual Studio 2010 and an XCode 4 project
ready to go.
